# Milestone 1: Communicating with Will Byers
Lonnie Souder II and Jacob Epifano

This milestone is a combination of learned concepts from Labs 1-4. The concepts covered here include GPIO, Timers, PWM, Interrupts, and UART communication. In this Milestone, we have created an Addressable RGB LED node that can be chained together with other nodes to form a system in which all nodes can be controlled through one message that is passed down through the chain. An application note can be found [here]().
